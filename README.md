工程數學2-project-1: Math2 Project1: Nuclear Bomb Temperature Field Modeling and Analysis with graph  

System of ODE’s and Phase Plane : Modeling cola Temperature Variation Over Time and Analyzing with MATLAB  

Modeling of Pandemic and Oscillator:   Discussing ODEs with different models  
Part 1: Analyze U.S. pandemic data from 2021 using the Malthusian growth model and the Verhulst model  
Part 2: Study a mass-spring-damper system with MATLAB and Python,  
visualizing parameter effects and comparing their impact on car dynamics    

Fourier series and transform : Use MATLAB to analyze and visualize dolphin and whale sounds, along with ocean noise.  
Perform Fourier Transform (FFT) to examine their frequency spectra   
and combine the FFT results to simulate the acoustic effects of dolphin and whale sounds together.   


仿生科技_第二組: Biomimicry design Inspired by Scorpions    
The project aims to address critical clinical challenges by integrating innovative design, leveraging technical expertise, and fostering collaboration. With a focus on market strategy, financial planning, and sustainable growth, it seeks impactful solutions.    

LEGO_Group1 : Simulating four-link mechanisms with LEGO, exploring universal joints, and brainstorming efficient power input designs  

NNfirst.ipynb : Built a neural network with four hidden layers to recognize digits from the MNIST dataset.  
You can also go directly to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HowV9ni0lMTnJy9WerZsJyQjUspaMsKy?usp=sharing) to view   
Tested the model using both a separate part of the dataset and my own handwriting to determine which model performs best in terms of:  
1.Accuracy  2.Resource consumption 3.Training time  
Used Gradio to present the results and explored how the number of layers (depth) and neurons per layer (width) impact the final outcome.
